### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Once in the record business, then music journalist, a librarian and and now an aspiring frontend developer.
I have studied HTML, CSS, Javascript, Responsive Web Design and at the moment I am learning React.
My main interests are sci-fi, comics, heavy psychedelic rock, basketball. Oh, and cats.
