Hi 👋 My name is Luca Cavallo
=============================

After years of experience as a journalist and librarian, I decided to start a new path in IT, combining my communication and analytical skills with technology.  
So I've spent a few years learning how to write code and I've recently discovered my passion for ethical hacking: I am currently studying to obtain my CPTS qualification.
* 🌍  I'm based in Bruxelles
* ⚡  I’m an avid reader and I love sci-fi, retro videogames, heavy psychedelic rock and basketball (let's go Celtics!).
